# Using grep, regular expression, and pipe, write an executable Shell Script with a
# single-line command to execute each of the following task:

# • Print all the names that start with either ’A’ or ’B’, AND contains 5 letters or less.
# (Save your answer as ”q2.sh”)
# • Print all the names that contains substring ”am” (case insensitive), and then sort
# the list alphabetically (ascending). (Hint: Do some research on which command
# can be used to sort list) (Save your answer as ”q3.sh”)
